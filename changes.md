1. There will be one more decision situation (also involving two options and three blocks), so you could already add place holders (e.g. the pictures from the Hard Lottery).

> Done.

2. for block II, we think it might be better if subjects only have the option to type in the % for option A and remove the slider (even though it was a lot of fun trying to click on the moving dot!). Also if they type in x we think it would be nice if the box on the right would automatically show 100-x. If possible, they would only be allowed to type an integer between 0 and 100.

> Done.

3. We also think that it would help to move both boxes closer to the center, make the boxes bigger, make it a little clearer (with labels) that the left box represents the % for A and the right box represents the % for B.

> Done. 

4. For the transition slide before block III, we're thinking it might make more sense to say "Please click OK to proceed to the next stage of the experiment" instead of "Now you will make decisions"

> Done.

5. For the block III review questions, we think it might make more sense to put them after all of the original block III questions (so you don't get the option to switch to all A or all B right after the original set of questions)

> Should have already been the case.

6. In the block III review questions, instead of "previously you were presented with the following options..." maybe use "previously you made N consecutive choices between the following options..."

> Done.

7. For all the "Option A" and "Option B" labels below the options in blocks II, and III, we think it would help to make the font bigger and bold (where not already bold). Also, we think the font could also be bigger/bold for the "BBBBBBBBBBBB" etc. string of original choices on the block III review pages.

> Done.

8. Maybe a "Thank you for your participation" slide at the end.

> Done.

9. Lastly, in block III (especially) we probably want subjects to be forced to spend a fixed amount of time on each question (even if that amount is very small) to ensure that they don't just try to get through the questions as fast as they can. Would it be possible to have a 1 or 2 second lag before the options become clickable, and another 1 or 2 second lag in between the time the options become clickable and the "OK" button shows up?

> Done.
